Create beautiful Facebook Share Images! We create screenshots of your Articles and Pages and use these as Facebook's Share Image

== Description ==

The only task of this plugin is to take an automatic screenshot of your WordPress page you want to link, and use a thumbnail of the screenshot as the Facebook's Open Graph image tag. By running this plugin, you simply need to include the URL in a Facebook post and nothing else. The image will be generated automatically. You don’t have to do anything else! After installing, this plugin will produce screenshot thumbnails for every WordPress page or blog entry that you provide as a link in a Facebook post. These screenshots will later be used as the thumbnail image on Facebook.
You don't need to do anything, simply include the link in your post!

= Why Use HAREMO Social Screenshots Plugin? =
A picture is worth a thousand words. Today’s Facebook users want to know what type of content they’re going to view before they click a link, and Facebook urges content creators to follow best practices of creating content that can be easily shared with Open Graph images. However, we’ve taken the guesswork out of creating images to their recomendations. The plugin does it all for you, and you won’t have to download your images, attach to your post, and then share - it’s an easy, streamlined process and it’s free!
We hope HAREMO Social Screenshots Plugin can help you share your content in a way that is more accessible and attractive to your readers.

== How it works ==
Each screenshot of your Articles and Pages has a corresponding screenshot that is generated on a Remote Server.
We use the URL of your page and send it to our API (located at (api.social-screenshots.haremo.de) to create the screenshot from your content. From there, the Screenshot sends back a link with the image file, and is automatically used by Facebook as the Open Graph image tag.
